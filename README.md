Tutorial  1 
Week 2 
Object Oriented Programming 
1. What is the difference between procedural programming  and object-oriented 
programming? 

2. Define Class and Object. 

3. Explain the difference between class and object using a simple example  of an education 
institute. 

4. What are the advantages of using object-oriented concept in application development? 

5. Explain the role and responsibilities  of a Systems Analyst in SDLC? 

6. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese a measure called body mass index 
(BMI) is used. The formulas for calculating  BMI are, 
BMI = weightInPounds x 703 
heightInInches2 

BMI value                result

less than 18.5           underweight ,
between 18.5 and 24.9    normal,
30 or greater            obese.
 
Write Java program which reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches then 
calculates and  displays the user’s BMI and result according to the below table. 


7. What is the value of MathGinie after each of the following statement is performed? 
MathGinie is declared as Double data type.  
a. MathGinie= Math.Abs(7.5) 
 
b. MathGinie= Math.Floor(7.5) 
 
c. MathGinie= Math.Abs(0.0) 
 
d. MathGinie= Math.Ceiling(0.0) 
 
e. MathGinie= Math.Abs(-6.4) 
 
f. MathGinie= Math.Ceiling(-6.4)
